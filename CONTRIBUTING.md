# Contributing

This repo is a training/demo project.

Rules:
- Keep changes small and focused
- Update the script-level CHANGELOG.md for any code change
- Do not commit results or large binaries
- Keep transaction names stable and business-focused
- Prefer readable code over clever code

PRs (recommended practice):
- One exercise per PR
- Include:
  - What you changed
  - Why you changed it
  - How you tested (VuGen run notes)
