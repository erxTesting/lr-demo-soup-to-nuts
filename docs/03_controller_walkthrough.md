# Controller Walkthrough

What you should learn here:
- How to add the script to a scenario
- How to set Vuser counts and ramp-up/down
- Why pacing and think time matter for throughput realism

Starter scenario idea:
- 5 Vusers
- Ramp up: 1 Vuser every 10 seconds
- Duration: 5 minutes
- Observe: TPS, response time, errors

Notes:
- This repo is about workload modeling and script structure.
- Controller tuning is a separate skill; keep first runs simple.
